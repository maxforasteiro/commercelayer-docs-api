# Delete a customer group

To delete a customer group, send a `DELETE` request to the `/api/customer_groups/:id` endpoint, where `id` is the id of the customer group that you want to delete.

## Request

  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.api+json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your-access-token'
```
{% endtab %}
