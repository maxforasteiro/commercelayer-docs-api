# Webhooks

Webhooks are used to send real-time events to external listeners.
When a webhook is triggered, Commerce Layer sends a POST request to the webhook's callback URL.
The object in the request body has the same format that you get when fetching the resource through the API.


### The webhook object

A **webhook** object is returned as part of the response body of each successful
[create](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/webhooks/create_webhook),
[list](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/webhooks/list_webhooks),
[retrieve](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/webhooks/retrieve_webhook),
or [update](https://docs.commercelayer.io/api/resources/webhooks/update_webhook) API call.
